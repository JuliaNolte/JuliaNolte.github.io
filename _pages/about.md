Hi! I am a Ph.D. Student at Cornell University's Department of Human Development (now known as the new Cross-College Department of Psychology).

**About Me**
I first joined the Human Development department as Cornell’s 2015-2016 Heidelberg Exchange Fellow and a Fulbright grantee. In 2017, I returned to Cornell to obtain a Ph.D. in Developmental Psychology with Dr. Corinna Löckenhoff.

My research interests span risk perception, decision making, lifespan development, and health. At the moment, I am working on tailoring health and risk information to the processing preferences of different age and patient groups. This work has earned me the 2017 Margaret Holmes-Rovner Award for Decision Psychology and Shared Decision Making (commonly known as the Society for Medical Decision Making's Lee B. Lusted Student Prize).

Before returning to Cornell, I worked with the Funke Lab for Problem-Solving at Heidelberg University (2013-2017) and Valerie F. Reyna's Rational Decision Making Lab at Cornell University (2015-2016). In addition, I have completed research visits with the Nock Lab at Harvard University (2016), the Cognition and Health Research Group at Oxford University (2016) and Cambridge University's Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication (2017).
